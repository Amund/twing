`constant`
==========

{% raw %}

> There is no language syntax to set nor to retrieve a constant. Twig specifications don't even describe what a constant is. As such, it is highly recommended to not use the `constant` test in your template and to consult your Twig engine implementation details if you really need to rely on this test.
